      <h2>Athens 3500BC.</h2>

      <p>
        Classical Athens was a powerful city-state. It was a centre for the
        arts, learning and philosophy, and the home of Plato's Academy and
        Aristotle's Lyceum. It is widely referred to as the cradle of Western
        civilization and the birthplace of democracy, largely because of its
        cultural and political impact on the European continentâ€”particularly
        Ancient Rome.
      </p>

      <p>
        Athens has been continuously inhabited for at least 5,000 years (3000
        BC). By 1400 BC, the settlement had become an important centre of the
        Mycenaean civilization, and the Acropolis was the site of a major
        Mycenaean fortress, whose remains can be recognised from sections of the
        characteristic Cyclopean walls. Unlike other Mycenaean centers, such as
        Mycenae and Pylos, it is not known whether Athens suffered destruction
        in about 1200 BC, an event often attributed to a Dorian invasion, and
        the Athenians always maintained that they were pure Ionians with no
        Dorian element. However, Athens, like many other Bronze Age settlements,
        went into economic decline for around 150 years afterwards.

      <h2>Athens mythology.</h2>
      <p>
        A major branch of classical mythology, Greek mythology is the body of
        myths originally told by the ancient Greeks, and a genre of Ancient
        Greek folklore. These stories concern the origin and nature of the
        world, the lives and activities of deities, heroes, and mythological
        creatures, and the origins and significance of the ancient Greeks' own
        cult and ritual practices. Modern scholars study the myths to shed light
        on the religious and political institutions of ancient Greece, and to
        better understand the nature of myth-making itself.
      </p>

      <p>
        The gods of Greek mythology are described as having essentially
        corporeal but ideal bodies. According to Walter Burkert, the defining
        characteristic of Greek anthropomorphism is that "the Greek gods are
        persons, not abstractions, ideas or concepts." Regardless of their
        underlying forms, the Ancient Greek gods have many fantastic abilities;
        most significantly, the gods are not affected by disease, and can be
        wounded only under highly unusual circumstances. The Greeks considered
        immortality as the distinctive characteristic of their gods; this
        immortality, as well as unfading youth, was insured by the constant use
        of nectar and ambrosia, by which the divine blood was renewed in their
        veins.

      <h2>Athens 2022.</h2>

      <p>
        Athens is both the capital and largest city of Greece. With a population
        close to four million, it is also the seventh largest city in the
        European Union. Athens dominates and is the capital of the Attica region
        and is one of the world's oldest cities, with its recorded history
        spanning over 3,400 years and its earliest human presence beginning
        somewhere between the 11th and 7th millennia BC.
      </p>
      <p>
        Athens is a Beta-status global city according to the Globalization and
        World Cities Research Network,and is one of the biggest economic centers
        in Southeastern Europe. It also has a large financial sector, and its
        port Piraeus is both the largest passenger port in Europe, and the third
        largest in the world.
